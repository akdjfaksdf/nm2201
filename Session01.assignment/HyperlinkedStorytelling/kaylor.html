		We were in the backseat drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar.

		We were a fresh page on the desk, filling in the blanks as we go. As if the street lights pointed in an arrowhead, leading us home. 
		<br><br>
		Windows swung right open, autumn air, jacket 'round my shoulders is yours. We bless the rains on Cornelia Street, memorize the creaks in the floor. <a href="betty.html"> Back when we were card sharks, playing games</a>, I thought you were leading me on. I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street before you even knew I was gone. But then you called, showed your hand I turned around before I hit the tunnel, sat on the roof, you and I.
		<br><br>
		You hold my hand on the street, walk me back to that apartment. <strong> Years ago, we were just inside, barefoot in the kitchen--sacred new beginnings that became my religion, listen. </strong> I hope I never lose you. I'd never walk Cornelia Street again. Oh, never again.
		<br><br>
		And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name. And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away. I'd never walk Cornelia Street again. And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends. I'd never walk Cornelia Street again. That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend. I'd never walk Cornelia Street again.
