<!-- first paragraph -->
  <h3> Betty, I know where it all went wrong </h3>
  <p class="regularPara">
  		Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym. I was nowhere to be found--I hate the crowds, you know that. Plus, I saw you dance with him. I was walking home on broken cobblestones, just thinking of you when she pulled up like a figment of my worst intentions.

  <p class="quotePara"> 
  		She said, <q> James, get in, let's drive</q>. 
  		</p>
  <p class="regularPara">
  	 	Those days turned into nights. Slept next to her, but I dreamt of you all summer long.

<!-- end of paragraph -->

<!-- second paragraph -->
  <h3> Betty, I won't make assumptions </h3>
  <p class="regularPara"> 
		About why you switched your homeroom, but I think it's 'cause of me. Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house. It's like I couldn't breathe. You heard the rumors from Inez. You can't believe a word she says most times, but this time it was true. The worst thing that I ever did was what I did to you. But if I just showed up at your party, would you have me? Would you want me? Would you tell me to go fuck myself, or lead me to the garden? In the garden, would you trust me if I told you it was just a summer thing? I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything, but I know I miss you.
  	</p>
<!-- end of paragraph -->

<!-- third paragraph with choice -->
  <h3> Betty, I'm here on your doorstep </h3>
  <p class="regularPara">
  		And I planned it out for weeks now, but it's finally sinkin' in. Betty, right now is the last time I can dream about what happens when you see my face again. The only thing I wanna do is make it up to you. So I showed up at your party. Yeah, I showed up at your party. Will you have me? Will you love me? Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends? If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings? I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything, but I know I miss you. Standing in your cardigan, kissin' in my car again, stopped at a streetlight--you know I miss you.
