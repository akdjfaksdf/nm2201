		Long handwritten note deep in your pocket. Words--how little they mean when you're a little too late. I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket. Good girls--hopeful they'll be and long they will wait. In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation. We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities. And time is taking its sweet time erasing you. And you've got your demons, and darlin' they all look like me. Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting, silence, the train runs off its tracks. Kiss me, <a href="betty.html">try to fix it</a>. Could you just try to listen? Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back. <strong> What we had a beautiful magic love there. What a sad beautiful tragic love affair. We had a beautiful magic love there. What a sad beautiful tragic love affair. </strong>
